# Towards clearer documentation:

:memo:

**I really appreciate the hard work that you exerted in developing 
this package.**  

So I would like to help in the documentation.


I would like to edit the front page of the documentation to 
make it look like this:

**https://github.com/OmarThinks/django-cheat-sheet/blob/main/lessons/5_graphql/lessons/1_django_restql.md**


To make it very clear for every one to how to start using 
the package immediately.  
It took me time trying to find out how to use it.  

**I will use the serialization on the User model**



**I would like to thank you again for the hard effort that
 you exerted in the development of this package.**
