# 1) Django REST Framework:



# 1) Avoid DRF Auth:

I do not recommend studying Django REST Framework Auth.  
Because **you will have to create your own endpoint 
for authentication**.  

With third parties authentication that we will explain later, 
you will have prebuilt and tested endpoints.




# 2) 3rd party auth packages:


1. Djoser
2. SimpleJWT
